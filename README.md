# `unix-adventure`

Become a Unix wizard.

Unix is a mystical experience that permeates computing from the humble lower-powered embedded device running BusyBox to the biggest server farms.

Unix was created in the [1960s and 1970s at Bell Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0) and remains hugely important in computing.

Many servers, phones, routers, embedded devices run an implementation of Unix such as Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, BusyBox, and FreeBSD.

# Install

To play `unix-adventure`, you will first need a Unix.

## Linux

If you are already running Linux, you are good to go!

## Mac OS X

If you are already running Mac OS X, you are probably good to go, but you might need to install the GNU versions of some tools with [brew](http://brew.sh) first.

## Windows

If you are on Windows, consider dual-booting to a desktop Linux distribution such as [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/). By dual-booting, you will be able to boot your computer into Linux or into Windows and all your files will still be available.

Another option is to install a virtual machine such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then boot Linux inside VirtualBox.

If you are stuck, ask some of your hacker friends for help getting set up with Linux!

## `npm install`

Once you have a Unix and [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, do:

```
npm install -g unix-adventure
```

to get a `unix-adventure` command.

Type `unix-adventure` to get started.
